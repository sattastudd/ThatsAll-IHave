<h2>Prologue</h2>
<p>
It is Rudra’s third day in the capital of India and he is running barefoot in the chilling hours of darkness. He came here to accomplish his dreams. Dreams are getting real…..but not the dreams, the Nightmares. He has never ever been so petrified in his life. He is panting, struggling for breathe but, his legs and brain have only one destination. He has to reach there as soon as he can. He has to find out if the worst fear of his life has come to be true. Rudra is too shocked to think or analyse anything at the moment. Neither can he cry nor can he speak. There is something which just choking him since he has received the most unpleasant news of his life. He is just running and running.
<br>
<br>
 When half of the city is caved in their blankets, he is sweating. His eyes are stoned. The shock is so massive for him that he cannot even cry although he wants to. Madly running with a blank face and a heart heavy accumulating a fear of losing his everything today, he reaches where he had to- AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Studies).
 <br>
 <br>
The place is in a chaos.  Although, it is a centre for more than 1000 visitors per day, the visitors have outnumbered the past records by many times today. As soon as Rudra gets the glimpse of the gigantic building which was capable to snatch all he had today, he stops! Not intentionally but because he couldn’t lift up his legs. He wants to enter inside swiftly but he is not able to lift up even a single step. He wants the probable bad news to be delayed as much as it can be. The voices coming from the building could be heard from a decent distance. 
<br>
<br>
Gathering all his courage and a load of fear I his heart he walks inside. The roars of pain could be heard everywhere in the vicinity. It was not only tears which were flooding today, blood streams were flooding too. Yes! Blood! Blood of men, women and children. Blood of the loved ones of people gathered there. 
<br>
<br>
Delhi was witnessing one more startling deed of carnage. And Rudra! A newbie…a young man…was too disturbed to analyse or even think about anything other than those two faces.
<br>
<br>
He was deaf…all he could see around himself was blood..blood of naives. A rush…rush for survival. A chaos…chaos for competence. Weeping mothers..lonely children..horriffied faces.
<br>
<br>
Rudra is rushing to find the two most important faces of his life. The two faces of the two women who light up his life, who are the joy, the beauty, the innocence, the meaning of his life. (pour more emotions)
Rudra is looking for his wife and three year old daughter.
